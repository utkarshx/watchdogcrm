<b>Free For All</b><br />
Assigns all web leads to "Anyone" and users can re-assign to themselves.<br /><br />
<b>Even Distribution</b><br />
Assigns web leads to whomever has the lowest number of uncompleted actions, evening out the number of uncompleted actions between users.<br /><br />
<b>Round Robin</b><br />
Assigns leads to each user going through the list one by one. <br /><br />
<b>Custom Round Robin</b><br />
Same as above but allows you to set custom rules.  i.e. if a contact comes in with a specific value, it will be distributed to a group of users you specify.
This option will not work unless you create custom rules.
<br /><br /><br />
<b>Online Only</b><br />
This option will filter your routing rule so that leads only go to a subset of the users who are logged in.  
i.e. if you set custom rules to go to 4 different users, but 2 are logged in, only those 2 will get the leads
